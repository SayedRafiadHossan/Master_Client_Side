                For those who have never encountered online learning, the
                biggest question is often what it is actually like. The caveat,
                as you know, is that online learning comes in several forms.
                Therefore, this is your chance to explain that to people. Point
                out that there are different types of online courses and
                programs, and that they’ll have to decide which is best for
                them. Then, explain the types of courses you offer and how your
                online programs work to give them all the information they need.
                This not only gives them information, but it increases their
                trust because you’re being transparent and giving them
                straightforward answers.

                There isn’t always a need for licensing or accreditation for
                online courses. However, some programs do require it. Either
                way, people will usually ask what type of training or background
                you have, as well as any licensing that’s available if that’s
                relevant. Make sure that you answer this question by telling
                them if you do hold any licenses or accreditation, as well as by
                explaining whether or not those are needed, and why. It gives
                them the confidence that you have the right experience and
                boosts your credibility because you’re offering additional
                information for the sake of education alone.

                There’s always a skeptic, and when it comes to online learning,
                there are often several of them. Everyone wants to know if
                online courses “really work”—and that’s a hard question to
                answer because there are several factors to consider. On a
                general basis, yes, online learning can be effective. However,
                that depends on whether the courses are set up properly, the
                provider is educated and experienced, and if the person taking
                the courses does well in a virtual learning environment. You
                should be able to explain these things to people so that they
                know what they’re getting into. Then, you can invite them to
                contact you to discuss whether it would be right for them.
